    <h1>Wanna know more about these Drinks???</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Coffee</dt>
        <dd>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[2]</dd>
        <dt>Juice</dt>
        <dd>Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production).[1] The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increases with a country's income level.[2]</dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Orange Juice</li>
            <dd>Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".</dd>
            <li>Apple Juice</li>
            <dd>Apple juice is a fruit juice made by the maceration and pressing of an apple. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin, which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal, or aseptic processing system containers, or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate.</dd>
            <li>Mango Juice</li>
            <dd>This delicious and hydrating mango juice is made by blending mango and water smoothly. Bursting with tropical fruity flavors, it is naturally sweet, easy to make, and comes together in minutes.</dd>
            <li>Grape Juice</li>
            <dd>Grape juice is obtained from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid. In the wine industry, grape juice that contains 7–23 percent of pulp, skins, stems and seeds is often referred to as must. The sugars in grape juice allow it to be used as a sweetener, and fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar.</dd>
        </ul>
        <dt>Tea</dt>
        <dd>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.[3][4][5] Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.[6][7][8] After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[9] There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[10] while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[11]</dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Black Tea</li>
            <dd>Black tea (also literally translated as red tea from various East Asian languages) is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white, and green teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also rarely used.[2]</dd>
            <li>Chai</li>
            <dd>With a few exceptions, the base of chai is a black tea. There are many variations of black tea, but Assam is the most common in chai, as it has a strong, full-bodied flavor. Some people will get fancy and use a mixture of teas—my mother combines Assam and Darjeeling tea in her chai because the former imparts "color and body," and the latter imparts "aroma and flavor," she says.</dd>
        </ul>
        <dt>Milk</dt>
        <dd>Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.[1] Milk contains many nutrients, including calcium and protein, as well as lactose and saturated fat.[2] Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies and immune-modulating components that strengthen the immune system against many diseases. The US CDC agency recommends that children over the age of 12 months (the minimum age to stop giving breast milk or formula) should have two servings of dairy (milk) products a day,[3] and more than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products.[4]</dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Coconut Milk</li>
            <dd>Coconut milk is an opaque, milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts.[1][2] The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, Central America, northern parts of South America and West Africa, where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.</dd>
            <li>Cow Milk</li>
            <dd>Cows' milk is a nutrient-dense food consisting of varying amounts of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. The major constituents of cows' milk are water (87.4%) and milk solids (12.6%), which includes vitamins, minerals, carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Cows' milk is known to contain many nutrients, including varying concentrations of fat and water-soluble vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and salts. The principal carbohydrate in milk is lactose. The lactose content of milk varies by species. Cows' milk contains about 4.8% lactose (12–12.5 g lactose per cup), whereas human milk has 7% lactose. In addition to lactose, minor quantities of glucose, galactose, and oligosaccharides are present. Milk fat is a complex lipid existing as an oil-in-water emulsion. Milk lipids are mainly triacylglycerols or fatty acid esters with glycerol, of which more than 400 have been identified. Phospholipids, sterols, waxes, and free fatty acids have also been identified.</dd>
